# Med Assist
Med Assist app lets patients connect to doctors and book appointments. The day is divided into time slots of 60 minutes each, starting from 9 am to 9 pm. Doctors can log in to the portal and declare their availability for slots on the given day.  Patients can book appointments / cancel existing appointments.

## Features
* A new doctor should be able to register and mention his/her speciality (Cardiologist, Dermatologist, Orthopedic, General Physician).
* A doctor should be able to declare his/her availability in each slot for the day. For example, the slots will be 60 mins like 9 am-10 am, and 11 am - 12 pm.
* Patients should be able to register. Patients should be able to search available slots based on speciality. Any order of slots is okay for viewing to patients.
* Patients should be able to book appointments with a doctor for an available slot. A patient can book multiple appointments in a day.  A patient cannot book two appointments with two different doctors in the same time slot.
* A patient/doctor should be able to view his/her booked appointments for the day.
* Patients can also cancel an appointment, in which case that slot becomes available for someone else to book.
